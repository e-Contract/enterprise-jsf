\chapter{PrimeFaces}

JSF has known a lot of component libraries over its history.
After almost two decades of JSF however, natural selection did set in,
resulting in the survival of just a few really high quality JSF component libraries.
The most prominent here is PrimeFaces \cite{PrimeFaces}.
Some of its major features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Client-side API for the components.
	\item Configurable style.
\end{itemize}
