Einstein’s 1905 paper on special relativity introduced a single invariant quantity that combines energy and momentum:

\[
E^{2}= (pc)^{2}+ (mc^{2})^{2}.
\]

* \(E\) – total energy of the particle (including kinetic and internal energy)
* \(p\) – relativistic momentum
* \(m\) – **rest** mass (the mass measured in the particle’s own rest frame)
* \(c\) – speed of light in vacuum

Certainly! Below is a simple Java program that prints "Hello World" to the console:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

This declares a class named `HelloWorld`.
