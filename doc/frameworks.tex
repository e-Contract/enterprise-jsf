\chapter{Front-end Frameworks}
\begin{TODO}{Under Construction}
	This chapter is still a work in progress.
\end{TODO}
Within this chapter we compare a popular Javascript front-end framework with JSF from a developer's perspective.
To do so, we construct a simple CRUD (create-read-update-delete) application using both technologies.
We are looking for a somehow objective reasoning whether Javascript based front-end frameworks are really that better compared to JSF web applications.
Some metrics to compare are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to maintain/understand build-system.
	\item Amount of framework API you need to have deep understanding of.
	\item Simplicity of the constructed application.
	\item Maintainability of the constructed application.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Model}
Both applications should use the same model.
Here we simply maintain a list of items.
The front-end should be able to display all items, and to remove/add items.
Our \texttt{Item} class looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../examples/frameworks/model/src/main/java/be/e_contract/model/Item.java}
Within a real production model our \texttt{Item} would of course be a JPA entity to manage its persistence.
But to keep things simple here, we avoid introducing JPA.
As you can see from the code, we use the \texttt{name} field somehow as a primary key.

Our \texttt{Model} class looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../examples/frameworks/model/src/main/java/be/e_contract/model/Model.java}
Again, to keep things simple we don't bother about aspects like transactionality, concurrency, security.
We do however introduce a "business" exception named \texttt{ExistingItem\allowbreak Exception} to be able to demonstrate proper handing of this within the front-end.
The source code of this exception looks as follows,
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../examples/frameworks/model/src/main/java/be/e_contract/model/ExistingItemException.java}

\section{JSF}
The JSF page looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../examples/frameworks/jsf/src/main/webapp/index.xhtml}
The corresponding CDI controller looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../examples/frameworks/jsf/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/Controller.java}
The Maven POM file to build our project looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../examples/frameworks/jsf/pom.xml}
