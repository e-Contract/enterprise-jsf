\chapter{Custom Components}
Within the chapter we explain how to construct custom JSF components.

\section{Tag Library}

We structure the application as deployable EAR. This is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ear}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{ear}
		\caption{EAR project structure.}
		\label{fig:ear}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
While you can put custom JSF components directly within your web application archive (WAR) file,
we strongly advice to directly isolate them within a separate JAR.
Some reasons to do so:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Within larger teams, this allows developers to specialize and take responsibility over the custom JSF library.
	Creating custom JSF components requires specific skills, that not all developers necessarily master.
	\item Most applications have multiple portals, and hence multiple WAR files. For example: an end-user portal and an administrative portal. A separate JSF library allows you to use the same components within different WAR artifacts.
	\item Directly isolating custom JSF components within their proper library makes it easier to later on propagate generic JSF components to for example a company-wide JSF library, or to push it even further towards open source (for example PrimeFaces Extensions).
	\item This allows you to have an extra test WAR specifically targeting the development of your JSF components.
	This avoid the need to deploy your entire business application during component development and thus will have a positive impact on the development speed of your custom components.
\end{itemize}
The Maven structure for our Java EE EAR project has been depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ear-structure}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{ear-structure}
		\caption{EAR Maven project structure.}
		\label{fig:ear-structure}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The Maven parent POM of our project looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/pom.xml}
We defined the Java EE API \texttt{javaee-api} as global dependency for all our modules.

The Maven POM of our tag library JAR module looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/pom.xml}

The Maven POM of our WAR module looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/pom.xml}
\begin{TIP}{Maven module naming}
	We use as \texttt{groupId} of project modules the concatenation	of the \texttt{parent} \texttt{groupId} and \texttt{artifactId}.
	This has the advantage of yielding a clean directory structure when pushing the project towards a Maven repository.
	Hence every artifact produced by this project, can be found under the same directory structure within the Maven repository.
\end{TIP}

The content of the WAR is similar to the initial example.

The Maven POM of our deployable EAR module looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/ear/pom.xml}

The tag library itself is a regular JAR with a specific structure (see also Figure \ref{fig:ear-structure} on page \pageref{fig:ear-structure}).
The most important file is our

\texttt{src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor file:
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=1-10]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}
You can name this file anyway you want, as long as it ends with \texttt{.taglib.xml}.
The above \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor file already contains some declarations of custom tags that we will define later on (file not shown completely here).

You can compile the example as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	cd helloworld-ear
	mvn clean install
\end{lstlisting}

Deploy the \texttt{helloworld-ear} EAR to the WildFly application server via:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	cd ear
	mvn wildfly:deploy
\end{lstlisting}

Check out the deployed application within a web browser by navigating to the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/helloworld-ear/

\section{Validator}
\label{sec:validator}
We start off with our first custom JSF component, a validator.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/validator/ExampleValidator.java}
Important for validators is to let a \texttt{null} or empty value pass to allow for non required form input fields.

We register this custom validator within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleValidator]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}
This allows us to use our validator via the \texttt{exampleValidator} tag.
Additional advantage is that we can easily document the validator within the tag library descriptor, making life easier towards developers that have to integrate our custom components.

An example usage of our custom validator is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/validation.xhtml}
Hence entering "foobar" as input will result in a JSF error message being displayed.


\subsection{Validator Parameters}
Validators can be parameterized to tune its behavior. 
A JSF  validator with a parameter attribute looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/validator/ParameterValidator.java}
This validator implements \texttt{StateHolder} to ensure that its state is correctly preserved over different requests.
The \texttt{saveState} and \texttt{restoreState} methods take care of preserving the state of our validator fields.

We register this custom validator within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=parameterValidator]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage of our custom validator is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/validation-parameter.xhtml}

\section{Output Component}
In this section we construct our first "real" JSF component.
This component simply outputs its value.
An output component inherits from \texttt{UIOutput}.
To give you a better idea on where to position \texttt{UIOuput} in the class hierarchy of JSF,
we depicted the most important JSF classes within Figure \ref{fig:jsf-classes}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.8,rotate=90]{jsf-classes}
		\caption{Most important classes for a JSF component library developer.}
		\label{fig:jsf-classes}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The source code of our custom output JSF component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/output/ExampleOutput.java}
As we are constructing an output component, we inherit from \texttt{UIOutput}.
Important here is to set the \texttt{id} attribute on our \texttt{span} HTML element to the value of client id.
This is required so that the JSF AJAX Javascript code can find our JSF component during response updates within the rendered HTML.

We explicitly set the renderer type to \texttt{null} to prevent a warning when using Apache MyFaces \cite{myfaces} as JSF implementation.

Important here is to use \texttt{writeText} to output our \texttt{value}.
This gives us proper HTML escaping and hence prevents a gaping XSS vulnerability within our component.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleOutput]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

\begin{TIP}{XML Descriptors}
While JSF allows you to define the tag directly via the \texttt{@FacesComponent} annotation,
we prefer to use the classical XML descriptors for several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item not everything can be declared via annotations.
	\item XML descriptors allow you to isolate the documentation of a component from the implementation.
	As not all developers are good technical writers, it can be very practical to have the component documentation separated from its implementation.
	\item there is nothing wrong with XML, really.
\end{itemize}
\end{TIP}

An example usage of our custom output JSF component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/output.xhtml}
We selectively update our custom output component via the \texttt{render="output"} attribute on the \texttt{f:ajax} tag.

\subsection{Output Component with Style}

In this example, we create an output component that is styled via a CSS style sheet.
Suppose we have an enumerate, which we want to visualize using different colors.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/output/ExampleEnum.java}

The JSF output component to achieve this looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/output/ExampleStyledOutput.java}
In this example, we perform the rendering via a separate \texttt{Renderer} implementation.
Having a separate \texttt{Renderer} has several advantages.
\begin{itemize}
	\item It keeps the code of the component itself clean.
	\item The \texttt{Renderer} implementation focuses purely on the rendering (and decoding).
	\item Some frameworks provide a nice base class to implement a \texttt{Renderer}, which automatically forces you to have a separate rendering.
\end{itemize}
Within our component we explicitly set the renderer type within the constructor via \texttt{setRendererType}.
This is actually only required to make \texttt{createComponent} to work without too much trouble.
If we don't do this, components created via \texttt{createComponent} can have the wrong renderer assigned.
See also Section \ref{sec:dynamic-components} \nameref{sec:dynamic-components} on page \pageref{sec:dynamic-components}.

The implementation of the \texttt{Renderer} looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/output/ExampleStyledOutputRenderer.java}
Depending on the value of our enumerate, we change the \texttt{class} attribute value of our rendered \texttt{span} element.
Obviously the \texttt{encodeBegin} method now also receives our component as additional parameter.

The corresponding

\texttt{src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/example-styled-output.css} CSS style sheet resource file looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=CSS]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/example-styled-output.css}
When creating CSS style sheets as part of a JSF component library, it is important to properly prefix your CSS classes to prevent clashes with other style sheets within your web application.
In our example, we prefixed every defined CSS class with \texttt{example-}.

We register this custom component and corresponding renderer within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleStyledOutput]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

We use this custom output component as follows,
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/output-styled.xhtml}

With the corresponding CDI controller,
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/helloworld/EnumOutputController.java}


\section{Input Component}
In this section, we construct our first custom JSF input component.
The source code of our custom input JSF component is given below:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/ExampleInput.java}
As we are constructing an input component, we inherit from \texttt{UIInput}.
We put an explicit \texttt{id} attribute containing the client id on our \texttt{span} HTML container element so JSF AJAX updates can locate our component.
Specific for input components is that we also \texttt{decode} incoming requests.

Our \texttt{input} element has a \texttt{name} attribute used to locate the request parameter during the \texttt{decode} phase.
Obviously the attribute value has to contain the client id to ensure its unique addressing towards our component.

Notice the usage of \texttt{getSubmittedValue()} and \texttt{setSubmittedValue()} during encoding and decoding.
The submitted value only gets propagated towards the actual value in case all input validators are happy.
Upon an input validation error, the component keeps working on the submitted value.
We also clear previous validation errors via \texttt{setValid(true)} when decoding the submitted value.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleInput]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage of our custom input JSF component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/input.xhtml}

\section{Rendering Children}
In this example, we demonstrate how to render the children of a component.
We do this by constructing our own \texttt{panelGrid} component.
The source code of this component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/PanelGridComponent.java}
As this component is neither an input nor output component, we simply inherit from \texttt{UIComponentBase}.
This component uses a custom attribute named "columns" to define the number of columns to be rendered within the table.
Via the \texttt{StateHelper} we force JSF to keep track of the internal state of our component.
This state is used during the JSF restore phase.
Notice how we index our state within the \texttt{StateHelper} using a \texttt{PropertyKey} enumeration.

Via the \texttt{true} return value of the \texttt{getRendersChildren} we indicate that we render our child components ourselves.
Within the \texttt{encodeChildren} method we render each child component via \texttt{child.encodeAll} selectively within our rendered HTML table.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=panelGrid]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage of our custom \texttt{panelGrid} component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/panel-grid.xhtml}


\section{AJAX Events}
JSF components can trigger AJAX events that are handled at the server-side.
The following component demonstrates how to fire such AJAX event at the client-side, and how to capture and process the corresponding AJAX call at the server-side.
The source code of our custom JSF component that can fire AJAX events looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/ExampleAjax.java}
A component that supports client-side events, needs to implement the \texttt{ClientBehavior} interface.
Our component defines a \texttt{click} client-side event as indicated via the \texttt{getEventNames} method.
This is also the default event as indicated via the \texttt{getDefaultEventName} method.

Within \texttt{encodeBegin} we weave in the client behavior Javascript code via the \texttt{onclick} Javascript hook of our HTML button.
At the server-side, we process our event within the \texttt{decode} method.
We first check whether our \texttt{click} event is part of the incoming request.
Next we verify whether it is really meant for our component by checking the client id, after which we delegate further decoding to the specific client behavior.
Notice that, despite the naming of \texttt{ClientBehavior}, client behaviors can indeed also trigger events at the server-side.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleAjax]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage of our custom JSF component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/ajax.xhtml}
Since we specified "click" as our default client-side event, we don't have to explicitly specify it via \texttt{event="click"} within \texttt{f:ajax}.

The corresponding CDI controller looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/helloworld/AjaxController.java}

\subsection{Custom AJAX Events}

One can also create custom AJAX events that contain component specific parameters.
An example custom event with some parameter looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/ExampleAjaxBehaviorEvent.java}
This custom AJAX event inherits from the base \texttt{AjaxBehaviorEvent} class and simply adds a custom parameter called \texttt{parameter}.

This custom AJAX event is passed as parameter to the CDI bean listener method as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/helloworld/AjaxCustomEventController.java}

The following example JSF component demonstrates how to fire such custom AJAX JSF event that contains a parameter passed from the client-side to the server-side.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/ExampleAjaxEventComponent.java}
We don't use \texttt{getScript} of the client behavior as we want to pass on our own parameter.
Within the \texttt{decode} method we decode the client behaviors as usual.
Only additional thing here is that, within \texttt{queueEvent}, we like upgrade the \texttt{AjaxBehaviorEvent} to our own flavor \texttt{ExampleAjaxBehaviorEvent}.
Notice here that within \texttt{queueEvent} we don't have to recheck whether the behavior source indeed corresponds with our component since the \texttt{decode} method already did this, and only fired the AJAX event towards our component anyway.

The corresponding \texttt{example-ajax-event.js} Javascript resource file looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Javascript]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/example-ajax-event.js}
Here we use the JSF client-side Javascript API \texttt{jsf.ajax.request} method to perform an AJAX request.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleAjaxEvent]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage of our custom JSF component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/ajax-event.xhtml}

\section{JSF Component with client-side API}
Modern JSF libraries like PrimeFaces provide a very rich client-side API on their components.
Within this section we demonstrate how this can be achieved.
The JSF component source code for this example looks as follows,
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/ExampleWidget.java}
We set some \texttt{data-} attributes that will be picked up by our Javascript code.

The \texttt{ejsf-widget.js} Javascript resource looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Javascript]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/ejsf-widget.js}
Here we basically create a generic \texttt{Widget} class within the \texttt{ejsf} namespace that allows us to resolve widgets on the client-side using the \texttt{EJSF} method.
Via \texttt{registerWidgetType} we can register concrete widget classes.
During document loading, we instantiate all the widgets according to their registered type.

The \texttt{ejsf-widget-example.js} Javascript resource, which contains a concrete \texttt{Widget} implementation, looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Javascript]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/ejsf-widget-example.js}
Our \texttt{ExampleWidget} Javascript class simply exposes a \texttt{setValue} method to change the content of the widget element.
Further we register our widget type so that it can get picked up during page loading by \texttt{ejsf-widget.js}.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleWidget]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage of our custom JSF component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/widget.xhtml}
Please keep in mind that the above construct is just an example.
JSF libraries like PrimeFaces offer similar functionality out-of-the-box that goes way beyond what we demonstrated here.
Good advice: don't reinvent the wheel, but use libraries like PrimeFaces.
See also Chapter \ref{chap:primefaces} for more information on PrimeFaces.

\section{Client Behavior}
JSF allows you to define components that only perform on the client-side.
These are called client behaviors.
Notice that AJAX events are also client behaviors, but they also decode at the server-side, and thus generate corresponding server-side events.
The point here is that you can have client behaviors that do not trigger anything at the server-side.

In this section we demonstrate an example client behavior where we change the color of a button when we move over it with the mouse.
Usage of this custom client behavior looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/client-behavior.xhtml}

The custom client behavior source code is given below,
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/behavior/ExampleClientBehavior.java}

The corresponding client behavior renderer:
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/behavior/ExampleClientBehaviorRenderer.java}
This renderer simply attaches its Javascript method invocation via the \texttt{getScript} method.

Via a tag handler we attach in our client behavior to its parent component.
The source code of the tag handler looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/behavior/ExampleClientBehaviorTagHandler.java}
Important here is to instantiate the custom behavior via \texttt{application.createBehavior} to ensure that the \texttt{@ResourceDependency} annotations on the renderer are interpreted by JSF.
We simply attach our behavior to the "mouseover" and "mouseout" client events of our parent \texttt{ClientBehaviorHolder} component.

The \texttt{example-client-behavior.js} JavaScript resource looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=Javascript]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/example-client-behavior.js}
Since we use only a single client-side event method for both "mouseover" and "mouseout" events, we have to distinguish between the two event types within our event handling method itself.

The \texttt{example-client-behavior.css} CSS style sheet looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=CSS]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/example-client-behavior.css}

We register this custom component and its corresponding tag handler within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=exampleClientBehavior]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

\section{Composites}
JSF allows us to define components entirely within XHTML.
Such components are called composite components, as they are basically a composition of already existing JSF components.
An example composite component \texttt{exampleComposite.xhtml} looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/exampleComposite.xhtml}
Important here is to put a proper \texttt{id} attribute with \texttt{cc.clientId} value so that JSF AJAX updates can locate our composite component.
When defining composite components, always pay special attention to provide a complete and correct \texttt{cc:interface} descriptor.
Thay way your IDE can give you nice hints about the parametrization of your composite component.

An example usage of our composite component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/composite.xhtml}
\begin{TIP}{Forms}
Never use \texttt{h:form} directly within your composite component, even if the component requires one to function (due to AJAX for example).
Rationale: if a developer puts another \texttt{h:form} around your composite component, you end up having an HTML form within an HTML form, which is pretty foobar.
\end{TIP}

\subsection{Backing Component}
A composite component can be further enhanced using a backing component.
We demonstrate such construct within the following example.
This composite component allows us to input a period (days and hours).
The \texttt{inputPeriod.xhtml} composite component XHTML source looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/inputPeriod.xhtml}
Via the \texttt{componentType} attribute we refer to the backing component.
Using the \texttt{binding} attribute we bind JSF components to our backing component.
Via the \texttt{cc} expression language variable we can access properties and methods of our backing component.

The corresponding backing component source code looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/ExampleBackingComponent.java}
Important for composite backing components is to set 

\texttt{UINamingContainer.COMPONENT\_FAMILY} as family.
Keep in mind that component state should always be handled via the \texttt{StateHelper} as components are basically request scoped.
The only class level variables you should be using, are those for binding child components, as done for \texttt{hours} and \texttt{days} in our example code.

Notice here the setup of both \texttt{encodeBegin} and \texttt{processDecodes} methods.
We have to correctly handle the submitted value here to ensure that input validations on our composite component use the correct intermediate value at all times.
E.g., if an input validation error occurs on value "xyz", an update of our component should still display "xyz".
Within \texttt{encodeBegin} we first update our child components using the submitted value, or if no submitted value is available, with the actual value.
Next we continue the rendering of our child components via \texttt{super.encodeBegin}.
Similarly within \texttt{processDecodes} we first decode our child components via \texttt{super.processDecodes}, and next we calculate our submitted value based on the submitted values of our child components.

An example usage of our composite component with backing component looks as follows:
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/composite-input.xhtml}
With the corresponding CDI controller given by,
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/helloworld/InputPeriodController.java}

\subsection{Children and Facets}
In the following composite component we demonstrate the usage of children and facets.
We do so by constructing our own panel component.
The source code of our \texttt{panel.xhtml} composite component looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/panel.xhtml}
We declare our custom facet, named \texttt{footer},
via the \texttt{cc:facet} element within the \texttt{cc:interface} section of our composite component.
The panel footer is only rendered when the \texttt{footer} facet has been set.
Via \texttt{cc:insertChildren} we insert our children within our composite component rendering lifecycle.

The corresponding CSS style sheet \texttt{panel.css} is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=CSS]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/ejsf/panel.css}

An example usage of our panel composite component is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/composite-panel.xhtml}

\section{Value Expressions}
\begin{TODO}{TODO}
	Write me.
\end{TODO}

\section{Method Expressions}
When using \texttt{action} or \texttt{listener} attributes, behind the scenes JSF/EL is using method expressions.
To demonstrate the usage of \texttt{MethodExpression} we construct a custom \texttt{Converter}.
The source code of our custom converter looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/converter/GenericConverter.java}
This custom \texttt{Converter} simply delegates its \texttt{getAsObject} and \texttt{getAsString} method implementations towards method expressions.
These method expressions are invoked like "just in time".
We implement the \texttt{StateHolder} interface to ensure that the state of our converter gets properly saved and restored.

Via a tag handler we attach our custom converter to its \texttt{UIInput} input parent component.
The source code of our tag handler looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/converter/GenericConverterTagHandler.java}
Notice how we define the method signature via the parameters of the \texttt{getMethodExpression} method.

We register this custom component and its corresponding tag handler within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=genericConverter]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

An example usage within a JSF page of our custom converter looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/generic-converter.xhtml}
The \texttt{getAsObject} and \texttt{getAsString} attributes on our custom \texttt{genericConverter} converter are interpreted as method expressions that refer to methods of our CDI controller.

The corresponding CDI controller looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/helloworld/GenericConverterController.java}


\section{Dynamic Components}
\label{sec:dynamic-components}
In this section we demonstrate how to construct dynamic components, i.e., components that change behavior at runtime.
Imagine we have a list of objects, each object has its own type as shown in the following example CDI controller.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/helloworld/DataController.java}
Each \texttt{Item} has its own \texttt{type} and corresponding \texttt{value}.

We want to construct a component that is capable of inputting this dynamic typed value, as shown in the example below.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/dynamic-input.xhtml}
Depending on the actual type of the item, the \texttt{dynamicInput} component changes its rendering accordingly.

Our JSF component for this looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/DynamicInputComponent.java}
Via the \texttt{@ListenerFor} annotations we indicate that we want to receive \texttt{PostAddToViewEvent} events from the JSF runtime.
These events are fired towards the \texttt{processEvent} method.
During the \texttt{PostAddToViewEvent} event we add specific input components to the component tree within the \texttt{processEvent} method.
Notice that we add all possible input components here,  since at this point we don't know yet which exact type will be required at render/decode time and it is of eminent importance to keep the view root component tree stable during the lifecycle of the page.

When programmatically adding JSF components to the JSF view root tree, it is important to always define a relative unique identifier for each component via the \texttt{setId} method.
Here we let our component to implement the \texttt{NamingContainer} interface.
This will ensure that all child components will have a unique client identifier.
Hence despite that we set the identifier for our child components simply to \texttt{text} and \texttt{boolean}, JSF will ensure unique client ids, even if there are multiple instances of our component on the same XHTML page.
Implementing \texttt{NamingContainer} has the additional advantage that it makes it very easy to locate child components via the \texttt{findComponent} method.

Via the \texttt{encodeBegin} and \texttt{encodeEnd} methods we give our component a client-side identifier.
This is important to ensure that AJAX updates can locate our component.

Via the \texttt{getRendersChildren} method we indicate that we take care of rendering/decoding our children.
And this is exactly what we do within the \texttt{encodeChildren} and \texttt{decode} methods where we delegate towards the appropriate child component depending on the type.
Hence we selectively render the child component that is capable of handling the item type.

We register this custom component within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=dynamicInput]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

\section{UIData}
Visualization of data tables is a commonly recurring aspect when constructing business oriented web applications.
Within this section we demonstrate how to devise a custom table visualization.
The source code of our custom \texttt{UIData} component looks as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/datalist/DataList.java}

The source code of the corresponding rendered is given below.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/datalist/DataListRenderer.java}
Notice how we play with \texttt{setRowIndex} to render our child components multiple times for all our rows.

We register this custom component and its corresponding renderer within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=dataList]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}

The following example demonstrates the usage of our custom data list component.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/data-list.xhtml}
An important remark here is that we really need to put the (input) components within an \texttt{h:column} tag if we want proper decoding of the components within the custom data table.
This can be seen within the source code of \texttt{UIData} where specific decoding happens for \texttt{UIColumn} child components.


\section{EL functions}
The EL can be seen as the glue between JSF and the CDI controllers.
In this section we demonstrate how to add custom EL functions.
In the following example we use a custom \texttt{gcd} function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two given numbers.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML]{../helloworld-ear/war/src/main/webapp/custom-function.xhtml}

This EL (expression language) function is defined as a public static Java function as shown below.
\lstinputlisting[language=Java]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/java/be/e_contract/jsf/taglib/GreatestCommonDivisor.java}

We register this custom function within our \texttt{.taglib.xml} tag library descriptor as follows.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,linerange=gcd]{../helloworld-ear/taglib/src/main/resources/META-INF/ejsf.taglib.xml}
