There is a strong tendency towards Single Page Applications (SPA), entirely constructed in some of the numerous Javascript frameworks out there.
However, for very large applications, where the (initial) development cycle surpasses the lifetime of the average Javascript framework, JSF is still a very viable solution.
By large applications we mean application with at least 50 underlying data tables, hundreds of pages, and multiple dialogs per page.
Construction of very large applications also tend to go well beyond the scope of your favorite Javascript framework tutorial.
We are talking huge investments here for companies that are hence looking for solutions that have a proven lifetime, to prevent having to rework the application like every 5 years or so because the once chosen Javascript framework hit its EOL.


We stick with Java 8 \cite{GoslingJoyEtAl14} and Java EE 8 \cite{JavaEE8}.
